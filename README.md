I'm a programmer who enjoys delving into data science and machine learning, using models to construct applications that can help people.

- I've been using Python for around 04 to 05 years, and have worked with most of the most popular frameworks.
- I've also been studying Data Science for the last 02 years, in order to make use of the most popular libraries, such as ``scikit_learn``, ``pandas`` and ``tensorflow``.
- Right now, I'm searching to learn new languages and ecossystems, and I decided to start with Go. Probably gonna touch more on Mojo eventually also, when it gets fully released.
- In the future, I want to learn more about Rust and C++, aside some JavaScript.
